* ui.xml: the UI file.

* form.xslt: create an HTML form for a given language and section of the UI
  file.

* transform.js: javascript driver for the client-side transformation, allows
  passing of arguments to the stylesheet. IE should work but is not
  implemented yet.

* transform.html: simple test to see if the above script works. Open it in
  Firefox to see.
