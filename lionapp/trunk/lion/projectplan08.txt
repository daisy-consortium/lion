The Project
===

What's it good for?
	* Use as the localization interface for AMIS, Obi, Tobi, Pipeline
	* Use Obi to record prompts
	* Use XUK format to maintain a template for the help file
	* Put MP3 upload on the website
	* Import/Export routines communicate between the database and the app's XML file (e.g. amisAccessibleUi.xml)

Options:
	* host with us
	* host yourself and install a module on your server (similar to wordpress)

Administrative tasks:
	* add a new user
	* import a new master (English) and review the potential changes
	* get files from export for distribution
	* review user activity
	* merge translated/recorded UI items into a DAISY book template so that the whole book doesn't have to be re-recorded
	
User tasks:
	* enter a text translation
 	* change text
 	* upload small audio files
 	* download an Obi project to do your recording all at once
 	* Upload your Obi project to import the new recordings into the system

Picky to-do's
===
Make optional:
	audio support
	accelerator
	error-checking

Rename "xmlid" to "xmlhandle"; make "TEXT"Add "new/changed/deleted" support
Modularize import/export routines

All project types use the same DB fields except for the following:

audiodata, audiouri, audioflag: ONLY IF AUDIO IS REQUIRED
mnemonicgroup: NOT USED BY OBI

Redo "DB" module without actual passwords; template per installation
